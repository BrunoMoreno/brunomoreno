### Bruno Queiroz

#### Hi there 🚀
I'm a software developer based in Petrópolis, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with over 14 years of experience in full-stack development.
Throughout my career, I’ve worked on a wide range of projects for companies such as McDonald’s, TIM, Michelin, MRV, Sephora, Plugg.to, Estoca, Facily, Personare, Acrux Capital, Celero, and many others.

I’ve worked extensively with technologies like Ruby, Python, PHP, Node.js, Go, React, Flutter, and Vue.js, always focusing on building scalable, maintainable, and efficient solutions.

In addition to development, I also act as a Tech Lead and consultant for several companies — helping teams design architectures, improve processes, and deliver high-quality software.
I'm always open to new challenges, collaborations, and opportunities to make an impact through technology.
