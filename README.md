### Bruno Queiroz

#### Hi there 🚀
I'm a software developer based in Petrópolis, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I have more than 14 years of experience in fullstack development for the most varied companies and projects like McDonalds, TIM, Michelin, MRV, Sephora, Plugg.to, Estoca, Facily, Personare, Acrux Capital, Celero and most others.

I've been working with a lot of technologies like Ruby, Python, PHP, Node.js, Go, React, Flutter and Vue.js.

I'm also a tech lead and consultant for some companies and I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities.
